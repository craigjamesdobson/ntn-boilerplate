I am a daughter, a wife, a dog mummy and toddler mumma living in beautiful Devon. 

Welcome to my little site! A site to support one arm of my creative octopus career and life, as I bring the world in to my little private writing bubble in self publishing my first book! Please, be gentle with me.

'The girl beneath the willow' first started off as a procrastination project. I was desperately stuck on the fantasy book I was writing (book one in a series of three), and started typing in a completely different style just to keep the creative juices flowing whilst my fantasy brain could take a nap. Well, two years later - after losing a year to becoming a mother (wow, doesn't time go too quickly with our little ones!) and exploring the agent route - I decided to finally do something with my book myself, to take charge! And here it is, for you. For all of you.

When I am not writing, you can find me on a stage, in indie films, teaching young people, or creating my own kind of magical world with my daughter.
