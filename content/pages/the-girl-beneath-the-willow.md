***Emmy thought that once her dad moved her and her brother to a new place, that things might start to get easier. That maybe she would be able to move on – that maybe, they could learn to live in a new way. What a stupid notion. For Emmy, there is no moving on from the incident that happened over the summer – and there is no way she is going to talk to you about it. Trapped in her ever-perpetuating anger and guilt, all Emmy can do is dream of the stars and what lies beyond them.***

***When Willow gets her to ask the kind of questions she has pushed aside, and start to make some positive choices, will Emmy be able to face herself once she finally confronts what happened that summer? Was it her fault? Would it happen again?***
