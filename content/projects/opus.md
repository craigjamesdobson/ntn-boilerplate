title: Opus
description: In 2019 I wrote a play for young care givers in a gorgeous theatre
  project working with Doorstep Arts based in Torbay. Working with the young
  people in drama based workshops, we supported them to create characters and
  ideas for storylines through drama games and activities. These little ideas
  were then workshoped, developed, and then created into a script by me for the
  children to learn and perform. They did this for their parents, carers, and
  workers.
