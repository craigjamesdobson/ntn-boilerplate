In collaboration with the Pauline Quirke Academy Exeter, I wrote a full length play to incorporate all of their students, to be performed on the Barnfield Stage in Exeter. The play followed four young soldiers from Devon being enlisted to the first world war, as well as those they left behind including the villages beloved horse, Tommy.
