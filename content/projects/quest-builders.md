I wrote three plays for Play Torbay to be performed by their children over the Spring and Summer period, called their "Quest Builders". 

They were site specific performances, written to include participation from their audiences, where the children would lead them on a journey or "Quest" and interact directly with them. 

The three sites for these were:

Sharpham house - "The Quest for Capability Brown"

Torre Abbey - "Mystery Quest"

Paignton Zoo - "Zoo Quest"
