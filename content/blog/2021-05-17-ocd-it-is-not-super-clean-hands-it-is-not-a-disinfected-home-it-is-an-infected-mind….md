title: "OCD: It is not super clean hands. It is not a disinfected home. It is an
  infected mind…"

I was coming to the end of my teaching contract in 2015, where I started to be plagued by thoughts of my house going up in flames. Many a morning I would miss the train – being physically pulled to run back to my house to check on it, unable to take one more stomach twisting step. On the day’s I managed to fight my way to the platform, I would be blinking back tears and steadying trembling hands until I got to work. Gosh, those journeys took so long. I would feel sick the entire time. Legs twitching to jump onto the tracks and run back somehow.

**I didn’t lock the door either, did I? Something terrible is going to happen.**

I’d tell myself that my neighbour has me on Facebook – she would surely let me know about a fire, wouldn’t she? Of course she would. Everything will be fine…I just needed to get to work.

Sometimes I would run upon getting home…not in public where anyone could see – but I would sprint through the park, and that stone in my throat would not fall till I saw no smoke coming from my door.

Every plug socket would be turned off. The taps checked. Certain plugs checked again – sometimes even turning the oven off at the mains – in this suddenly frantic and new routine of making sure nothing terrible would happen whilst I was away.

It lasted a long while, and it was exhausting, creeping up symptoms anew when big things in my life changed. When we got our dog? Well, I would sob the whole journey in the car driving to a job: playing out in my head his puppy screams as he was trapped in his crate surrounded by hot flames. How he wouldn’t be able to escape. How frightened he would be – how unthinkably awful it would be to die that way. The thoughts would consume me. The shakes, the acid stomach, the oh so many pictures played out like torturous films before my eyes – overshadowing the tarmac of the road as I drove with bleary eyes.

**My puppy was going to die, and somehow it would be my fault.**

So what happens, with an OCD mind when you fall pregnant? Well, fire wasn’t on my mind anymore, but the unrelenting cloud of dread certainly was. It poked nastily at the excited bubble I was in. It whispered in the back of my head – told me I was a fool for already downloading my pregnancy apps and making a list of names. I fought it, though. Fought harder than I did with the train rides and the non-existent electric fires. I wasn’t going to let my mind ruin this for me. This was a joyous time, and after years of talking about it with my husband, I couldn’t wait to be a mummy.

**But what happens when your intrusive thoughts come to pass?**

I think every woman blames themselves in some capacity when they lose a pregnancy. Was it that herbal tea I drank? When I ran back with my dog from a walk? That heavy thing I carried? What’s wrong with my body – something must be wrong for it to kill my baby. It’s me, isn’t it?

**Told you not to download those pregnancy apps.**

My mind took over completely in my next pregnancy, resulting in my “semi diagnosis” in OCD after seeking out professional help. I wouldn’t let myself be excited again – for I would lose this baby too, right? I could never not think about it. Could not stop myself from thinking – knowing – that I would lose this baby too. That’s the thing about intrusive thoughts that have you tightly by the throat…it isn’t just a fleeting thought, it’s a spiteful reality. It is as real as those hot flames. It is as real as a car going into the back of yours and killing your dog as he sits in the boot. As real as getting out of the car and screaming in distress to have the blood soak your trousers as you lose this other baby out of shock. It’s as real as the blood on the tissue you check after going to the toilet – every time you go. Another nasty reality you live within as you tred water in your own.

But more on that later. I am holding my rainbow daughter as she sleeps.
